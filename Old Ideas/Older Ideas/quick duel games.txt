at the end of level:
	score screen
	pause
	cloudberry: THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE (a note that takes up bottom 3rd of screen?)
	score screen disappears
	to the death!

survival, stay afloat, only fblocks and blobs!
survival, tons of fireballs all of the sudden (and alternating up/down elevators. other stock rooms? such as hexagram pattern of thin blocks)
survival, with lasers. all vertical. start with 5, then 6, then 7, etc. give warning, then go. erase old lasers. (could do moving laser patterns)
press A/B 100 times! (with progress meter) (random combo?) (progress meter is you riding a blob?)
falling block rain
one single elevator going up into a spike ceiling. have to jump off and get back down. gets faster and faster.
alternating up/down elevators, spike ceiling, void below. faster and faster. (or diagonally tiled)
firewall maze
line of blobs (moving up and down) (fuck each other over!)
lay a spike whenever you land on the ground. forces you to move.
lay a firespinner. short enough to jump over. make it blue while its not fatal. couple of levels to jump around between.
	OR, random spawn. warning light, then pops in
the ground is tiled in ghost blocks (standing wave pattern?) (can push each other!)
red light green light (laser the moving players!)
jump rope, with a spikey guy! (can push each other! and jump on each other) (double dutch!)
one fast moving coin (jet pack and triple)
all falling blocks (can push each other!)
falling ceiling with one safe spot (can push each other) (goes slowly, then pauses, rumbles, and falls quickly?) (or, falls quick then stops, repeats twice) (or just steady fall) (randomize between the two!)
turn into blobs (pop, pop!) tap A to flap and go up, otherwise fall, cement blocks falling! smash you, squash!
hot potato/tag. 10 second countdown. stunned for half a second when you are tagged, or can't tag for a half a second. tagged person is holding a bomb above their head. draw it stupid, programmer art style
odd ball
