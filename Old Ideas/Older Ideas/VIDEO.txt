Must have:
	1 video showing off pure obstacles, and mixed, with long cuts, not tightly edited.
	1 video showing off difficulty progression. Make fun at the beginning "Everyone is so damn worried this game is impossible"
	1 video showing off Hero Factory
	1 video showing off Hero Rush



ending:
	music dies, pan up last part of castle to balrog laughing. cut to zoom in of bob with cape flowing. pause, THUD level cleared. coming august blah blah


Dynamic Difficulty

"Build", "Fill", "Play", "Share"

"Balrog Gets a Castle"


close up shot of bob running (with cape flowing?)
	on black background?

swap to black. pause. balrog ROAR. pause. swap to a HARDCORE level with intense music

4-player bungee

Cloudberry person with arms up, "Yippee!"
	or the cloudberry wave

blob man

use only cool stickmen:
	!!! cape-only stickman! (zoomed in a bit more)

show off some cool level geometries (dense in-phase spikey-guys)
				    (dense fireballs. all going down-right 45 degree angle. or not dense, but just the outline of the dense region)

survival level:
	FIREBALLS, one shot with only vertical fballs, with bob in center
		   one shot with radially inward fballs, with bob in center (choose one of two?)

kill-all-blob level

get-all-coins level (with awesome moving coin patterns)
