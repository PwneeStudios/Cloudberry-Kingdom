Hi everyone, this is Jordan Fisher from pwnee Studios, here to tell you about the PWN Your Face Cloudberry Kingdom competition that pwnee Studios is putting on.

What is the PWN Your Face competition and why are we bothering?
The competition involves our most recent game, Cloudberry Kingdom. It's a classic side scrolling platformer, with a twist: it is STUPID hard.

Really, check out some of these screen captures. One of our goals making this game was to create the hardest platformer of all time. We think we've succeeded, but there's a bit a of a problem. Is this shit even possible to beat?

OK, we actually do know it's possible. We've programmed a computer to beat it, the question is, are humans up to the challenge?

Like the epic show down between Kasparov and Deep Blue of yore, it's finally time for the true gaming heros of our generation to come forth and prove mankind's mettle.

What are the stakes besides maintaining our superiority over a silicon uprising that threatens to dominate all of mankind?

Well, a thousands bucks. How's that?

Here's how it works. Play through Cloudberry Kingdom on the hardest difficulty. When you beat it, a challenge will open up in Arcade mode. Beat the challenge and send us a video.
First gamer to do so wins the prize, and the gratitude of the human race.

So Bust out your controllers and let's see what you've got. Frankly, well.. I've got my money on the machines.
