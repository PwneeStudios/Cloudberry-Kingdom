00:00:00.633	+	Where is she Kobbler?
00:00:02.102	+	Why do you waste your time, Bob? 
00:00:04.166	+	She broke your heart before, she'll do it again.
00:00:06.573	+	I'm not talking about the princess, Kobbler. I'm here for the orb!
00:00:11.011	+	Bravo Bob! You're finally using your head. 
00:00:14.300	+	Too bad you're gonna lose it!
00:00:15.749	-
00:00:20.587	+	That is one nasty papercut!
00:00:23.000	-
00:00:26.960	+	Looks like your burnt your Kobbler.
00:00:28.500	+	Is it true, Bob? You didn't come for me? You came for... this?
00:00:33.600	+	I'm sorry Princess.
00:00:35.301	+	No worries! Now killing you is a whole lot easier.
00:00:38.772	+	Really!? That's messed up!
00:00:41.274	+	Goodbye Bob!
00:00:43.343	+	Here we go again!
00:00:45.000	-	
00:00:51.500	+	Well, this looks familiar.
