Customize:
	'Gametype': geometry, seed, colorize background and tileset
	'Hero': can move in air, jump acceleration length, initial jump velocity, jump acceleration curve, size, gravity, max upward speed, num jumps, jetpack length, jetpack strength, friction, x acceleration, top speed, top fall speed,
	'Obstacle': derive blocks from master class, or have functions they all call to implement: fading, motion (lots more motion types, have lil diagrams and multiselect which ones to use)
		also: size, colorize, invert color, contrast, thin/not thin, density, speed, period offsets
		also: fill patterns (and whether to keepallunused, do tunnel, do floor only tunnel, do ceiling only tunnel)
	Berry Note: Press (Y) [click the {gears}] for advanced customization

Super advanced menu:
	Wood back. Light blue bubble on left half, with impact font menu over it (medium size font). berry bubble on the right for explanations.
	abstract ring thingey

** hero customize, per hero, no 'custom'?: gravity, friction, acceleration.x/y, scale, jump accel type																
	SAND BOX TO TEST HERO (multiple predesigned levels? have little simplistic drawings to select between)	


Pull autogen params out of style into piece
track autogen params in pieceseed. can have them pre-created if need be (no need for callback!)
