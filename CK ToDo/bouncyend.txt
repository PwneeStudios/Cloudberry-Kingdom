Finish testing Cos vs Sin

Cos vs Sin

-0.0757568243582935




Poker, CK, FD, SRS, FMM/Fractal, EC2, Retool
Network (MikeB/Han, programmers, meetups)



Human vs 1. Make pretty. Commit.
Exact sim 1 vs Random, many different random, always less than 1 vs B(1). Test other than 1.


Fine comb investigate.
	2x5 look at as many ShowdownNodes as possible.
	More thorough testing against random perturbations (both with old sim and new monte sim)
	Complex betting: why EV(B(1),1) < 1?
	Compare naive complex to optimized complex. Should be nearly the same.
Proper Royal cards
Save/Load
Play against a Nash.


Junction optimize. Benchmark (CPU and memory).
Should never need Collision.
Optimize memory.
Get rid of NaN? By shrinkwrapping PocketData
Suit reduce.




Non-naive combine (broken for RaiseCallFoldData)






Errands:
Rec letter
Tanno security
Medina
verizon pay
Debit, Adam+Code
Buy shit (sweaters, phonechargers, boots, hotpad)



Energy (tracking, biding, planning, experimenting)
Happy (stay aware, relax, enviro, no reddit, study/social instead, no home, decorate)
Heart (eval, hit projects, network)

eval ->
	Poker. CK while evaluating. 
Soldier/Captain





-------pwnee--------------
Fix contact form
New video
Business cards
T-shirts?

-------Cloudberry---------
(A) to enter name in highscore.
Awardment/shop menu for xbox
Some spaceship lvls too easy (bouncy and spikes)
Really make Cart lvl easier.
Add alternative heros in campaign? choice is good? few more heros in Rush2 would be sweet.
Custom hero castle. Short campaign. Big question mark on selected screen instead of castle.
Xbox build (default arguments)
Agressive big FBlock. Show him fall down after you on previous level.
PC version: fix xbox controller.
Find Dave todo list.
Easier cart levels (widen the pillars, jump later). Easier box level?
Cart intro level: more interesting. BIG Thwomps? Princess screams.
Box level: more interesting, more didactive. "Build up momentum for big jumps"
Only one tiny bob level. Add place ghost/bouncy level? Later have a '4 or less' level.
Maniacal laugh on entering Dark Tower. Thunderstrike?
Send to Eric.


-------PinkyTwirl---------
Alt+Y,H in terminal is search
2,3,4 mildly broken
Terminal override (both). Chrome override.
Investigate: Press Alt and Pinky runs an xmodmap bash command to hardwire JKLI as arrow keys.
Remap CAPS as Ctrl, and then CAPS+jk is for tabbing.
L_Alt + R_Alt and then some letter -> focus to some application. Or maybe Alt+CAPS. Hardwired for some things (by name lookup), for others (particular bash shells) you can dynamically set it.


-----------Food-------------
Current schedule: Vitamin D in the early AM, eat breakfast early, dinner no later than 8.

Yes:
Roasts, liver, chicken breast, steak, sushi
Onions, fresh almonds, crucifers, sweetpotato+butter?

Probably:
Butter/ghee
Yogurt, cheese
slow cooked potato/lentil/carrots/rice

Experiment:
Flax seed, green powder, green shakes
Tuna steaks
Lard, bone stock
Strawberry, zuccinis, yellow squash, collards, fresh walnuts, tomato, pork tenderloin, coconut manna (other brand)
Try small amounts of: Berries (reduced?), hard boiled eggs, lentils/pinto




------Workout------, 2 a day, 1 set to almost failure, WARM UP, maybe hot pack first
Curls, Pullups, Chinups, Sideups, Tricept extension, 1 legged squats (break up?), abs, military press
face pull, arm raises, sprint, leg raises, fly, dips?, shrugs, upright facepulls, lunges, deadlifts







WARNIG: Break at Hat.GetTexture, Optimize code turned off, FunRun, RemoveUnneedAssets, Viewer, BackButton exits game!, STAThread, SimpleLoad, Volume, ConsoleWriteline. On PC ESC shouldn't quit. Back shouldn't quit on XBOX.
WEBSITE: mouse over color. brink title below and only on front page. algorithm section. use checker background. timelapse of development (show beard)

Xbox project:
	Build: GAME;NOT_PC
	XNA GS: icon = icon/Big128.png

Memory:
	.loadby sos clr
	.sympath
	!name2ee c.exe WindowsGame1.ObjectData
	!dumpclass 04be3b58
	!gcroot 0311442c

Fast load:
	Game plays reasonably well even without everything loaded! Better this than a 25 second load!
	When others need to get a texture, just get the eztexture, don't load it
	If they need the width/height, then preload it by hand
	Get rid of .boxes
	Small pause at beginning of load
	Parallel make the level, start it early
	Fade to black before load is done
	pop out loading bar? pop in too? (after 1 second of black)

-------Post-todo-----------
Tegmark Wormhole
Medina (thesis graddiv contact wilcoxon@graddiv.ucsb.edu)
Ben and Brian!
PinkyTwirl: M-f, M-d is incremental search forward/backward, nice keys for switching domain of search? prn mode
Late Fees
Children of the Deep!, meetups (paleo meetups?)
(TrueName/MaroonedInRealTime, Quarantine/PermutationCity, The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences), QED by Feynman
Fractal\Poker\ better PinkyTwirlKeyboard?
Ed Boyden
Leslie Greengard (talk with Ken first?)

verizon -> pay mom (use the 100 buck voucher)





---------CK-todo------------


Potential polish:
	Running campaign time?
	QM above head before explode into hero in a box. QM explodes? Or fadepops down before explosion.
	Berry princess for not hardcore campaigns (only at end?) witty text?
	Hero Rush icons, make stick out more? neon next? neon stickmen icons? Use spinner pivot texture? Shrink for Rush2 when there are more?

	Alternate obstacles: upside-down floaters, or upside down plus different motion (box?), fireball head?
				different blobs, different firespinners
				old school pinkies?

	neon stickmen? FUCKIN COOL

	Negative phsxstep for first attempt on all levels. Longer on wall levels.

	Change hero powerup
	Masochistic castle: Firesnakes in background?

	To Small Bob:
	Auto-smash when you're underneath
	Or coins, or finger pointer

	mini map ghouls and ghost style on loading screen?
	game type: gauntlet (every hero type, escalation style)

	Color palette selection for bob customize (make this unlockable?)

	hardcore. twice? wheelie and double jump? inverse implosion effect? or regular implosion?
		neon black/white fblock in top left. glows when ready.
	button level (swap out standard effect for suckin effect. change qdrawer.defaulteffect? or map basic -> suckin)
		Save bob positions! make sure start platform is standardized. Rotate during suckin.
	initial intro, camera pan?

	wind sound in intro screensaver.

	fireball pinkies?

	other fun levels? hardcore! undanger zone. hold princess. darkness. special. more wall levels? continuous? button lvl? big zoomed out?
	Bonus challenge:
		decreases in difficulty as you fail (after credits?)
	Upgrade choice progression. score screen with three upgrades, clouds under them, finger pointing
	
	Credits -> rain stops after boss, bright terrace, fade to night over time. The End.

	Door indicators (door color, icon, hand pointing, etc)

	Category menu, delete lil piece of cord

	Princess interaction: due it via the princess, so that regular is never slowed down


Potential:
	x's over Stickman's eyes on score screen (on his side?)

	redo fireball. dark level with light around fireballs?? (fballs from off screen)
	bubble fireballs, bubble pops after jumping on and ball falls (place level!)

	Fancy Feet: no obstacles, 60 seconds per level, lava raises afterward

	blasted blobs{zoomed out, last blob flashes, jump on to EXLPODE, limited lives, GUI bubbles up in middle}

	dancing berry load screen (against blue backdrop with clouds)

	Hat store (buy bundles)

	Torch place level. Obstacles only exist on second pass?

	Right and left trigger to move ALL sliders in advanced customization

XBox Do:
	default arguments in functions
	fix double path?
	category menu control
	text on edges of screen
Minor bugs:
	Replay squished for psychedelic man
Unreproducible Bugs:
	Custom level, 2 pieces -> watch computer goes to 2nd piece
